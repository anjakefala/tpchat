Tpchat is a kind of textpunk webchat with history and irc gateway.  Has a kind
of shared diary chat feeling.

Primary design goals:
   * reliable
   * pragmatic
   * safe-for-work
   * unicode-friendly

The server uses the Twisted framework (Python), connects to another irc server, and becomes a long-polling webserver that routes messages.  The web client uses jQuery and tries to be as transparent as possible.
