bugs:
  - what to do with simultaneous user logins?  logout old one
    - js needs to detect logged out and redirect to login, not go crazy
    - just go back to login always?
    - maybe related to caching issue?
  - firefox caching issue (login -> chatlog)
  - scroll to bottom when new text not added sometimes
  - disconnect from irc server unrecoverable
  - login page: name/form focus on load
style:
  - top/left margins on login page
  - bottom bar fixed height

  - test: session cookie lasts 12 hours?
  - investigate send timeout after error (contributing to lost messages?)
  - server exception when old client reconnects
