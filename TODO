goals:
    - pragmatic
    - simplicity
    - under-designed (safe-for-work)
    - unicode-friendly
    - familiar
    - archival: tone is more of a shared diary than a chatroom
    - reliable
    - allows for deep quality contact


features:
  - individual unstored chat: click to prepend '/msg nickname' in window
    - delivered to active session only
  - generic /command interface
    - /clear
    - /favicon
    - /msg
  - set cookie for initial setting of nickname, sessionlife

bugs:
  ! what to do with simultaneous user logins?  logout old one
    - js needs to detect logged out and redirect to login, not go crazy
    - just go back to login always?
    - maybe related to caching issue?

  - scroll to bottom when new text not added sometimes
  - disconnect from irc server unrecoverable

  ? firefox caching issue (login -> chatlog)

style:
  - top/left margins on login page
  - bottom bar fixed height

  - test: session cookie lasts 12 hours?
  - investigate send timeout after error (contributing to lost messages?)
  - server exception when old client reconnects
